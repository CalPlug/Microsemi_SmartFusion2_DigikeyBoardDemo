                SmartFusion2 CoreUARTapb polled transmit and  receive example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates how to use the CoreUARTapb driver to transmit
and receive data in polled mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project requires USB-UART interface to be connected to a host PC. 
The host PC must connect to the serial port using a terminal emulator such as
HyperTerminal or PuTTY configured as follows:
    - 57600 baud
    - 8 data bits
    - 1 stop bit
    - no parity
    - no flow control

This example displays a message on HyperTerminal then echoed back characters
typed in HyperTerminal

NOTE: This example project will work with SoftConsole v4.0 onwards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project is targeted at a SmartFusion2 design which has CoreUARTapb
enabled and connected to a host PC. The example project is built for a design
using a SmartFusion2 MSS APB clock frequency of 71MHz. Trying to execute this
example project on a different design will result in incorrect baud rate being
used by CoreUARTapb or no output if CoreUARTapb is not connected.

This example project can be used with another design using a different clock
configuration. This can be achieved by overwriting the content of this example
project's "drivers_config/sys_config" folder with the one generated by Libero
as part of your design's creation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Redirecting CoreUARTapb to RS232(USB-UART) connector on SmartFusion2 Eval Kit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that it is possible to redirect CoreUARTapb to the J18 USB-UART connector
on the SmartFusion2 Eval Kit. This can be done in your hardware design by selecting to
direct the CoreUARTapb TXD and RXD signals to the FPGA fabric and then connecting
these signals to top level ports assigned to pin H19 for TXD and pin G18 for
RXD.

This example is built to execute on an M2S090T die. You will need to overwrite
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
