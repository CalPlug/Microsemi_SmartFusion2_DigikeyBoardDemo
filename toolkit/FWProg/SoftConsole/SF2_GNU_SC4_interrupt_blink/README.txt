                    SmartFusion2 CoreGPIO interrupt blink example
================================================================================
This example project demonstrates the use of interrupts that can be generated
by CoreGPIO ports configured as inputs.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example project operates as follows:
  - CoreGPIO Single bit interrupt is enabled and connected to MSS 
    Fabric interrupt 4. So GPIO 0 and GPIO 1 interrupt service routine is 
    called with FabricIrq4_IRGHandler.
  - The program blinks all LEDs when no interrupts occur.
  - Pressing the SW2 button will cause a rising edge interrupt on GPIO 1. The
    GPIO 1 interrupt service routine is called as soon as SW2 is pressed and
    switches on the LED for eight times the usual blinking delay. Leaving SW2
    pressed has no effect since GPIO 1 is configured as a rising edge
    interrupt source. This can be verified by the fact that the LED will
    eventually start blinking again even if SW2 remains pressed.
  - Presssing the SW1 button will cause a level interrupt on GPIO 0. The
    GPIO 0 interrupt service routine will be called as soon as SW1 is pressed
    and switches on the LED for eight times the usual blink delay. Leaving
    SW1 pressed will cause the GPIO 0 interrupt service routine to be called
    continuously since GPIO 0 is configured as a level interrupt source. This
    can be seen by the LED remaining switches on as long as SW1 is pressed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project is targeted at a Cortex-M3 design running on the SmartFusion2
Eval Kit board(090). The design should have an instance of CoreGPIO version 3.1 located
at address 0x30000000 with GPIOs 2 to 5 connected to LEDs and GPIOs 0 and 1 
connected to switches SW1 and SW2 respectively.The example project is built for a
design using a SmartFusion2 MSS APB clock frequency of 71MHz.

This example is built to execute on an M2S090T die. You will need to overwrite
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
