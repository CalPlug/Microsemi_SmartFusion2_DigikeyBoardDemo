# Microsemi_SmartFusion2_DigikeyBoardDemo for the Maker Board
Demonstration application for the Microsemi/Digikey Demonstration board.

THis project contains two parts:  1a) The FPGA fabric project (Built in Libero 11.8), 1b) The Cortex-M3 Microcontroller Project (Built in SoftConsole 5.1), and 2) The ESP8266 program built in Arduino IDE with the plugin for ESP8266 programming (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) installed via the Boards Manager.  A quick guide to installing this was developed by Sparkfun:  https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide/installing-the-esp8266-arduino-addon

Note:  The Microsemi SmartFusion Digikey Maker Board has the capability to interface both the ESP8266 (8 pin module) in addition to a ESP32 module that is soldered down to the PCB as an optional addition.
