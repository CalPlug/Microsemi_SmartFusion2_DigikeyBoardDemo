This folder contains  the most recent Libero project for the Digikey maker Board with the Microsemi SmartFusion 2 FPGA.

To operate:
1) Upload the ESP8266 project on your ESP8266:  https://github.com/CalPlug/Microsemi_SmartFusion2_DigikeyBoardDemo/tree/master/Espressif_ESP8266-ESP32_Applications/ESP8266/ESP8266_web_interface from the Arduino IDE.   You can do this using an external programmer or by using your Maker board as a firmware flasher.
