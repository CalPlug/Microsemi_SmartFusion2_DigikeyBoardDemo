ESP32 Toolchain Setup with Arduino IDE

There is a well documented workflow for this.  Two guides are especially good:

Guide 1: https://techtutorialsx.com/2017/06/05/esp-wroom-32-uploading-a-program-with-arduino-ide/

Guide 2: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/windows.md

In general here are some tips to make it work out well:

1) Follow the folder paths to the letter.  The ESP32 tools should be in a folder named esp32 in a folder named espressif in a folder named tools in your Arduino sketches folder (you may need to create this path, including the tools folder)
2) You can download the zip file from Github and build out the files in the folder from this rather than cloning using the GIT utility.
3) When you run the git.exe file to download the xtensa tools, do so with elevated (admin provledges (run as administrator).  I had issues having it properly build out the folders without this and had to have it run a couple times.
4) Chean up the files in the ESP32 folder so just the ones critical for the Arduino IDE to recognize the toolchain exist.
5) remove the external libraries path from Arduino --> properties dueing this operation.  Once I did this, it seemed to work better.
